Contributing
------------

More quotes will be added as I find them. However, if you feel that
there are some missing quotes (which there definitely are!), *please*
feel free to `make a pull request <https://github.com/lwm/csq/pulls>`__,
you can find the current list of quotes
`here <https://github.com/lwm/csq/blob/master/csq/quotes.txt>`__. Go
ahead and `fork this
repository <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`__!

You will need the ``2.7`` and ``3.4`` interpreters installed to run the tests with
`tox <https://codespeak.net/tox/>`__.

::

    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/csq
    cd csq && mkvirtualenv csq-dev
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .  # install csq locally
    tox  # run the tests
